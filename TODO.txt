Watchdog
========

1.0
---

* logs output to a file and rotates then properly, separate or combined for stderr & stdout?
* move ~/.watchdog.xml to ~/.watchdog/watchdog.xml

Future
------

* config to limit the number and/or age of log files kept
* switch away from an xml config file?  or at least allow a yml or rb config file as well?
* split barkers into separate files
* remove duplication in arguments passed to bark()
* configure smtp barker and try it out
* extract formatting logic into a formatting class?
* configurable summary head and tail and '...' elipsis
* don't combine stderr and stdout but manages them properly
* set growl options, sticky, icon, priority, host, port
* watchdog that barks via text message (email?)
* configure Jabber connection details to make it work with an SSL'd jabber server
* automate TODO.txt and create a CHANGELOG and use that info as the commit message when doing rake move-on.
* automate some interactive tests, so execution is automatic but assertions are from manual input
* bark via jabber & growl at a fixed interval with a few lines... i.e., every 10 minutes with 5 lines.  means I need 
  to track duration of execution for bark_lines
* switch to simultaneously calling bark_line on each barker
  use a threadpool or something so I don't create a too many threads (# lines * line-by-line barkers)
