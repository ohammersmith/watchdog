Watchdog
--------
* truncated/summary of output in a bark, rather than the full thing, configuration per 

* bark when a command took over a threshold of time
* watchdog that doesn't combine stderr and stdout but manages them properly
* watchdog that prints to stdout incrementally, rather than waiting until the whole file is done

* set growl options, sticky, icon, priority, host, port
* logging how long the command took to run
* watchdog that logs output to a file and rotates then properly (maybe this replaces one of the misc features)
* watchdog that barks via text message (email?)
* configure multiple Jabber ID's
* configure multiple email addresses
* configure Jabber connection details to make it work with an SSL'd jabber server
* logging to a stdout file and a stderr file
* logging the command run
