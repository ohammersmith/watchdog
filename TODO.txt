Watchdog
--------
* print to stdout incrementally, rather than waiting until the command is done
* logs output to a file and rotates then properly, separate or combined for stderr & stdout?
* config to limit the number and/or age of log files kept
* move ~/.watchdog.xml to ~/.watchdog/watchdog.xml

* configurable summary head and tail and '...' elipsis
* watchdog that doesn't combine stderr and stdout but manages them properly
* set growl options, sticky, icon, priority, host, port
* watchdog that barks via text message (email?)
* configure Jabber connection details to make it work with an SSL'd jabber server
* automate TODO.txt and create a CHANGELOG and use that info as the commit message when doing rake move-on.
